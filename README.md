# IMDb-Machine-Learning
Some implemented Machine Learning algorithms applied in a binary ('successful' or 'not successful') classification problem using real world data from IMDb.
The same Jupyter Notebook has been reported in Italian Language and in English Language, using the following titles:

* IMDbITA.ipynb In Italian 
* IMDbENG.ipynb In English 

These two notebooks are really long as they described an high number of different algorithms and each algorithm is formally and mathematically explained, in a detailed manner. Some equations may not been well formatted so we decided to use some .html version of the notebooks too. You will have them reported in the same project.
